I need you to modify hv_generate_video.py to work with the HunyuanVideo-I2V model structure. An example script to generate a video from an image is located at HunyuanVideo-I2V/run_sample_image2video_dynamic.sh. The model architecture is different than the Hunyuan text to video model. The subdirectory HunyuanVideo-I2V contains the github repository for running the HunyuanVideo-I2V model. I need to make it work with hv_generate_video.py. Modify hv_generate_video.py to run the new HunyuanVideo-I2V model. It should include applicable args such as --i2v-mode, --flow-reverse, --i2v-resolution, --i2v-image-path and --i2v-stability.
